## Getting Started

File structure

Olivia changed this to test something

Changed it again

There will be at least one more change after this

- the backend app starts at `server.js`
- `src/client.js` is compiled and served as /client-bundle.js
- components and their styles are in `src/components/` :-)
- view templates are powered by the .jsx files in `src/presenters/`
- stylus files like `styles/style.styl` are compiled and served directly as `build/style.css`
- Files in `public/` and `build/` are served directly
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

application models -> presenter -> DOM

#### Remixing this project

Once you remix this project, it'll come straight to life! The only external dependency that doesn't remix cleanly is OAuth login -- see the [FAQ](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/community?path=FAQ.md) for a workaround.
