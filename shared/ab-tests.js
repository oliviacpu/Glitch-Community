// a test group's weight determines how likely someone is to be placed in it
// users will be assigned to groups in proportions matching their weights
// the exact probability for a group is its weight / the sum of all weights

// the value is sent into the react code in response to useTestValue(name)
// it can be whatever is relevant for the test, the type doesn't matter

// changing a group's weight won't affect people who've already been assigned
// if you want to do a rolling release it'll take some extra finagling
